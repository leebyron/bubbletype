create interfaces for the different kinds of forces to make a better
framework for creating new kinds of forces

unary force applies a force to all particles. Gravity is a unary force
applying a vector field would also be a unary force.

binary force applies between two particles, such as a spring.

"spacial force" ?

Types:
None
One
All

None - None - moot
None - One - singly applied unary force
None - All - globally applied unary force
One - One - binary force
One - All - globaly applied binary force
All - All - globaly applied binary force (but different)


none - one: simple force

// this is a simple force for the world, like gravity.
none - all: unary simple force

one - one: binary force

// would this really ever be necisary? edge case would be apply binary to all things
one - all: world force?

all - all: world force

two kinds of forces
unary forces - like gravity
binary forces - like a spring

apply to a particle, or to the world
new Spring(start, end, etc)
or
new Spring(world, etc)
